<p> Video games are electronic games played on a video screen, normally on a television, a built in screen when played on a handheld machine, or a computer. There are many types, or genres, of these games. Role-playing games, trivia games, sports games, and platformers are just a few examples. Video games usually come on CDs, DVDs or digital downloads, but many games used to come on cartridges. The device used to play a video game at home is called a console. <p>

<p> There have been many types of consoles and home computers used to play video games. Some of the first were the Atari, the Sega Master System and Nintendo Entertainment System. Newer video game consoles are the Xbox One and the PlayStation Four. The best-selling video game console of all time is the PlayStation Two, made by Sony. People can also use PCs to play games, which are sometimes called PC games. The older consoles do not have new games developed for them often. People can play portable video games anywhere. Mobile devices also can download games, making them portable gaming powerhouses. The first video game ever is often said to be a computer game called Spacewar. In fact, some ideas of video games can be found before people made Spacewar. <p>

<p> When the first computers began to be made, three people had some ideas to create the basis of actual video games. Ralph Baer is the first man to have thought of the idea of video games. Later, A.S Douglas, of the Cambridge University in the UK, made a video game on a computer in order to illustrate one of his speeches. The game, called OXO, was a tic tac toe game. Another early game was called Tennis For Two, similar to the later Pong, to entertain visitors to Brookhaven National Laboratory. <p>

<p> One of the most famous and one of the earliest video games ever is called Space Invaders. Space Invaders was made as a coin operated machine but a version has been made for almost every different game console and home computer ever available. <p>
